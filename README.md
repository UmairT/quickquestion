The objective of this project is to build site that will allow users to post ephemeral questions and answers.  Users can post questions and solicit answers from the community, but only for a short period of time such as 10 minutes.  When users visit the site, they can see and respond to questions that are currently active, or post new questions of their own.  When a question expires, it should no longer be active.  (If you prefer, it may also disappear completely, a la SnapChat).
